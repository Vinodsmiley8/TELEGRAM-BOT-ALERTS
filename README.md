# User Uploaded Code

This archive contains the exact Python file you uploaded and a short README.

## Files included
- `TELEGRAM BOT ALERTS.py` - Your original uploaded Python file (unchanged).
- `README.md` - This file.

## How to use
1. Inspect the code in `src/fb6e84ac-5225-46bf-b3e4-4ccde3fba2fb.py`.
2. If it requires dependencies, install them as needed (use `pip install <package>`).
3. To run (example):
   ```bash
   python src/fb6e84ac-5225-46bf-b3e4-4ccde3fba2fb.py
   ```
   Adjust the command if the script is meant to be imported rather than executed directly.

## Notes
- I did not modify your original file.
- If you want me to include a `requirements.txt`, `.env.example`, or convert this into a full git repo structure, tell me and I'll prepare an updated zip.
